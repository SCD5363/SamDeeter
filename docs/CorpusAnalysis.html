                    <p>The Man in the Iron Mask" is a historical fiction novel, written by Alexandre
                        Dumas, that takes place in the 1600s in France. Aramis, one of the former
                        musketeers and a bishop, goes to the Bastille to visit Philippe, the
                        imprisoned twin brother of the current king, Louis XIV. He tells Philippe
                        that he can put him on the throne, switching him with his brother. This
                        piece takes place before War and Peace which was written in the 1800's.
                        However these two texts have similarities and difference throughout. The two
                        pieces have overlapping themes such as honor, Patriotism, Love, and History.
                        In the Corpus Analysis from Voyant you can see that King, Monsieur, and man
                        are some of the most used words other than names and articles. Whereas in
                        War and Prince, man and French are some other the biggest words through.
                        They both have some form of nobility focus on the center of the story. Both
                        have a focus on France, War and Peace is mostly set in Russia and France
                        acts either as an Ally or enemy throughout the book while The Man in The
                        Iron Mask takes place entirely in France. </p>

                        Love, and History. In the Corpus Analysis we can see how the texts relate to
                        each other. Prince, man, and French are some other the biggest words through
